# Elevatika's Main Website is Now Open Source

> Haven't had time to clean the code yet. The theme is based on Stackbit's `Ampersand` theme.

## Getting started

- Install `hugo` for your os
- Run `git clone git@github.com:CkCreative/elevatika.git && cd elevatika`
- Run `hugo server`
- Replace linked `/static` files, edit what is in the `/data` `/content` folders to suite your needs and you're good to go.

## Building for production

- Run `hugo`
- Copy all content in `/public` to your server
