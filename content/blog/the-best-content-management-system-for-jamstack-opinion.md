I have been using Netlify CMS for more than one year now. Until I came across this amazing book: [Modern Web Development on the JAMStack](https://www.netlify.com/oreilly-jamstack/) by Netlify.

A few pages in there, I found the list of content management systems that are git based and it mentioned [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) and [Forestry.io](https://forestry.io).

Forestry.io sincerely took me by surprise: how come I've never tried this?

Anyway, let's go slow.

## What is JAMStack?

JAMStack is simply a short form for JavaScript, API and Markup. In most cases, the term is used to describe modern websites that do not require you to own a server in order to run.

You can learn more about JAMStack in [this amazing website](https://jamstack.org) that introduces you to all the concepts of JAMStack.

## What I love about Netlify CMS

To be sincere, I like all my website and contents in one place. So, I have read about Contentful and frowned because I don't really want to have my website all over the place. Even though Contentful is great if you like their idea.

So, I chose Netlify CMS because it saves my content directly to my git repository.

## What has been the pain in Netlify CMS

I mainly post using my phone and then later do any edits from my computer. However, with Netlify CMS, it crashes every time I try deleting something on the editor. I dont know yet what this is all about. It always gives a weird error. I think it's got something to do with [Slate not supporting mobile very well yet](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate/issues/2062).

To overcome this, I have been using Writer Plus for Android to draft the posts and then open Netlify CMS and paste the markdown text.

This is cumbersome a little. But for the price of free, Netlify CMS is amazing! 

## What I love about Forestry.io

I haven't used this CMS for more than two days yet. But I am already hooked. I mean, I don't have to worry about the editor crashing. Also, the setup didn't take me more than 5 minutes since I just  imported the front matter from my existing documents and use the same folder I set up for Netlify CMS for the media. 

What's even cooler is that this same setup allows me to still run Netlify CMS at `/admin`  and the Forestry.io CMS from their website. Therefore, if things fall apart with Forestry, I simply go back to my old posting flow. 

## Conclusion 

I will obviously have to update this post to include my experience as things progress. However, its pure love for now.
